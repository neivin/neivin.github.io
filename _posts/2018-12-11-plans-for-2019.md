To say that I've been terrible at updating my blog would be an understatement. However, I do want to make a concerted effort to maintain this page starting from now (read: next year)

I have some plans for blog posts and hope I can find the time and energy to complete them.

# What to expect?
Some of the things I want to post here are as follows:

- Book reviews (once I start reading regularly again)
- Photos of the places I visit
- Track my fitness journey (running and climbing)
- Talk about my career and my experiences working in the bay area

These ideas are by no means fleshed out and will probably be a slow process that rolls out throughout the course of the year as I figure things out along the way.

It's the journey that counts, right?
