# Who am I?
My name is Neivin Mathew.<br/>
That's pronounced *nay-vin*, although I'll respond to any variation of it at this point.

# What am I doing with my life?
I'm currently a software engineer at [Stripe][0]. Before Stripe, I worked at a small company called [Index][1]. Index was acquired by Stripe in March 2018.

I currently live in San Francisco, California. I moved here from the Toronto area on June 22, 2017 after graduating from the [University of Guelph][2], and have been living in this amazing city every since.
