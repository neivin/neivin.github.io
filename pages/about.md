# Who am I?
My name is Neivin Mathew.<br/>
That's pronounced *nay-vin*, although I'll respond to any interpretation of it at this point.

# What am I doing with my life?
I'm currently a software engineer at [Stripe][0].

Before Stripe, I worked at a small company called [Index][1]. Index was acquired by Stripe in March 2018. I moved to San Francisco from Toronto in June 2017 to work at Index, and have been living in this amazing city every since.

Prior to Index, I was pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at the [University of Guelph][2] in Ontario, Canada.
