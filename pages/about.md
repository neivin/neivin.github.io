# Who am I?
My name is Neivin Mathew.<br/>
That's pronounced *nay-vin*, although I'll respond to any interpretation of it at this point.

# What am I doing with my life?
I'm a software engineer at [Stripe][0] working on [Stripe Connect][1]. <br/>
I previously worked at Index, a startup in the payments industry. [Index][2] was acquired by Stripe in March 2018.

I graduated from the [University of Guelph][3] in 2017 with a Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science.
