I was a voracious reader during my school years, but like most growing kids in the 21st century, the number of books I read took a sharp dive as more and more pieces of technology became a bigger part of my life.

As of writing this, I have begun to regret the fact that I don't read much anymore.

# Currently reading

# Previously read
This isn't an exhaustive list of all the books I've ever read in my life, but a list of the things I've read since I made the conscious decision to try to read more.
I would be very impressed if someone out there has a list of everything they have ever read...

I've highlighted books I really enjoyed and would recommend.
