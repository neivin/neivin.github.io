# Important Notes

<li>Zelda will <b>eat random food/trash on the street</b>. Be hyper vigilant when walking her on city streets since she's always looking for food scraps to eat. She can chew on sticks a bit but not excessively.</li>
<li>Zelda can get <b>possessive of high value treats</b> and exhibits resource guarding behavior. Be careful giving her high value items (bones, bully sticks, etc.) in the presence of other dogs who may try to steal them.</li>

# Food

<ul>
<li>Zelda eats this dry food/kibble: <a href="https://www.purina.com/pro-plan/dogs/dry-dog-food/complete-essentials-shredded-blend-chicken-rice-probiotics">Purina Pro Plan Adult Complete Essentials Shredded Blend Chicken & Rice</a></li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 0.85em; color: #666; font-style: italic;">Included cups (1 cup measure and 0.5 cup measure)</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Zelda feeding amount (2.5 cups per day):
  <ul>
  <li><b>Breakfast:</b> 1 cup leveled</li>
  <li><b>Lunch:</b> 0.5 cups leveled</li>
  <li><b>Dinner:</b> 1 cup leveled</li>
  </ul>

<p style="font-size: 0.85em; color: #666; font-style: italic;">Feed her leveled cups (not heaped on top)</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>She usually eats between 8:00-9:00am in the morning, 12:00-1:00pm at noon, and 6:30-7:30pm in the evening</li>
<li>You can feed Zelda in her purple slow feeder bowl. Golden retrievers have a tendency to eat too fast and vomit, so the slow feeder is recommended.</li>
<li>She <b>will not eat until you tell her</b> to. You can point at the food bowl and say "<b>Okay get it</b>" to tell her to eat. Pointing and walking away should also work if she isn't responding.</li>
<li>There should be enough food for all meals, but in case of emergencies, PetCo usually carries the kibble and I will cover any costs you may have to incur.</li>
<li><b>Avoid feeding her any human food or table scraps</b>. She will beg relentlessly.</li>
</ul>

# Behavior

<ul>
<li>Zelda will generally just sleep most of the day, but will play with other dogs if they are around.</li>
<li>She loves people and dogs alike and will want to be near you most of the time. She doesn't have any separation anxiety, will never bark and can generally be left alone for 6-7 hours at a time.</li>
<li>She is not destructive towards anything, and will not steal food, etc. She is very curious and likes to explore, and sniff around.</li>
<li>She likes to dig and chew dirt/sticks/leaves so be wary of leaving her alone outside for too long. You might find her covered in dirt after a few minutes.</li>
<li>Zelda is <b>not allowed on furniture</b>. If she does get on your furniture, you can yell "<b>AH AH</b>" loudly and push her off. She will get the message quickly.</li>
<li>She usually sleeps in her own bed at night but will lay down anywhere during the day (rugs or cool floors)</li>
<li>She never barks but will whine if she wants to go outside to potty. She has a habit of whining in the mornings to go potty, but can usually hold it in. Shut her out of your bedroom at night if you find her annoying.</li>
</ul>

# Cleaning/Grooming

<ul>
<li>As a Golden retriever Zelda has long fur and a double coat. She is a heavy shedder and might be something to watch out for.</li>
<li>Zelda likes rolling around on the ground and generally may get dirty playing outside.</li>
<li>We generally brush her everyday with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Show-Tech-Transgroom-Tangles-Slicker/dp/B00TYEMIK8">slicker brush</a> (blue brush with small pins).
  <ul>
  <li>A quick brush after she is dry will take out most of the dirt from her fur.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>The least effort way to clean her is to wipe her down with wet wipes. (EarthRated wipes)</li>
<li>The best way to clean her is if she is dirty:
  <ul>
  <li>Soak a towel in warm water and wipe her down to get rid of major stains.</li>
  <li>Dry off with a towel/let her air dry.</li>
  <li>Brush out dirt with slicker brush.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>If she gets dirty enough that you need to bathe her, she will resist at first but settle down eventually.</li>
</ul>
