# Important Notes:
- Zelda is **allergic to Penicillin** based drugs. Facial swelling and hives if exposed. The vet records indicate this already.
- Zelda loves to eat random trash on the streets. Be hyper vigilant when walking her on city streets since she's always looking for food scraps to eat. She can chew on sticks a bit but not excessively.
- Zelda can get possessive of high value treats and exhibits resource guarding behavior. Be careful giving her high value items (bones, bully sticks, etc.) in the presence of other dogs who may try to steal them.
