    Hello, my name is Neivin.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am passionate about readable and reusable code, beautiful design and good food. Although I don't have a favourite technology, I have the most experience working in Java, C and Python.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love learning new things.
    <br>
  Recently, I have been playing around with Android development, writing amusing Python scripts, and have also tried picking up the guitar.
