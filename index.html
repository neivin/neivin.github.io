  <p>
    Hello, my name is Neivin.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a third year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am passionate about scalable, reusable software, intuitive interface design and physical and mental health.
    I don't like limiting myself to specific tools or technologies, but I am most experienced in Java, C and Python.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love learning new things.
    <br>
    Currently, my energies are focused towards learning Android development, applications of computer graphics and French. (Désolé pour mon mauvais Français!)
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love basketball. A lot.
  </p>
